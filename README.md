CloudNativeWebApi
This repository contains a cloud-native Web API project built with ASP.NET Core, designed for scalability and resilience in cloud environments. It follows microservices principles, containerization with Docker, and orchestration via AWS ECS. The CI/CD pipeline automates building, testing, and deployment to AWS, with all infrastructure resources provisioned using Terraform.

Overview

Technologies:

ASP.NET Core for the API backend.

Docker for containerization.

AWS services: ECR for image registry, ECS for container orchestration.

Jenkins for CI/CD.

Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC).

Key Features:

Modular architecture with separation of concerns.

Automated testing and deployment pipeline.

Cloud-native design emphasizing scalability, fault tolerance, and observability.

Project Structure
Assuming a standard .NET multi-project solution:

CloudNativeWebApi (Main API project): Controllers, API endpoints, and configuration.

CloudNativeWebApi.Core (Business logic): Services and domain logic.

CloudNativeWebApi.Models (Shared models): Entities and DTOs.

CloudNativeWebApi.DAL (Data access): Repositories and database interactions.

Tests folders: Unit and integration tests.

Dockerfile: For building the container image.

Jenkinsfile (or pipeline script): Defines the CI/CD process.

Terraform scripts (in a separate directory or repo): Provisions AWS resources like ECS cluster, ECR repository, and services.

Prerequisites
.NET SDK 8.0 or later.

Docker installed for local builds.

AWS account with credentials (for ECR/ECS access).

Jenkins server configured with necessary plugins (e.g., for AWS and Docker).

Terraform installed for infrastructure setup.

Git for cloning the repository.

Infrastructure Setup with Terraform
All AWS resources (e.g., ECS cluster, task definitions, services, ECR repository) are created and managed via Terraform.

Navigate to your Terraform directory (if separate) or include scripts in this repo.

Initialize Terraform:

text
terraform init
Apply the configuration:

text
terraform apply
This sets up:

ECS cluster (cloudnativewebapi-cluster).

ECR repository (cloudnativewebapi).

Task definition family (cloudnativewebapi-task).

ECS service (cloudnativewebapi-service).

Ensure your Terraform files match the names in the pipeline (e.g., CLUSTER_NAME, SERVICE_NAME, TASK_FAMILY).

Local Setup and Development
Clone the Repository:

text
git clone https://github.com/SanthoshAthili3101/CloudNativeWebApi.git
cd CloudNativeWebApi
Restore and Build:

text
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release
Run Tests:

text
dotnet test
Run Locally:

text
dotnet run --project CloudNativeWebApi
Access the API at https://localhost:5001 (adjust port as needed).

Build Docker Image Locally:

text
docker build -t cloudnativewebapi:latest .
docker run -p 8080:80 cloudnativewebapi:latest
CI/CD Pipeline
The pipeline is defined in a Jenkinsfile (or the provided script) and handles automated workflows. It runs on any agent, with stages for checkout, build, test, Docker image creation, ECR push, and ECS deployment.

Key Environment Variables
AWS_REGION: 'ap-south-1'

ECR_ACCOUNT_ID: Your AWS account ID.

ECR_REPO_NAME: 'cloudnativewebapi'

IMAGE_TAG: Build number (e.g., from Jenkins BUILD_NUMBER).

Credentials: Use 'aws-creds' binding for AWS access.

Pipeline Stages
Checkout: Pulls the latest code from SCM.

Setup .NET SDK: Verifies .NET installation.

Restore & Build: Restores packages and builds the project in Release mode.

Test: Runs all tests in projects ending with *Tests.csproj, collecting results.

Docker Build: Builds and tags the Docker image using the project's Dockerfile.

ECR Login and Push: Authenticates to ECR, creates the repo if needed, and pushes the image with build tag and 'latest'.

Deploy to ECS: Updates the task definition with the new image, registers a new revision, and updates the ECS service.

Post-Build
Always cleans the workspace.

To trigger the pipeline, commit changes to the repo and let Jenkins handle the rest. Monitor Jenkins logs for any issues.

Usage
API Endpoints: Base URL is deployed via ECS (check your load balancer or service endpoint).

Example: GET /api/[controller] (e.g., /api/users).

Authentication: [Add details if implemented, e.g., API keys or OAuth].

Monitoring: Integrate with AWS CloudWatch for logs and metrics.
